## Overview
This post introduces the **Acceptor-Connector pattern** [[POSA2](/references/post-references)], which **decouples connection establishment and initialization** from the components that perform application logic after a connection is established. I’m exploring this pattern through a **simplified** implementation inspired by the [Adaptive Communication Environment (ACE)](https://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html).  
My goal here is to share what I've learned through a simplified implementation.

## Simplified Acceptor-Connector framework implementation
I built a small, learning-oriented Acceptor-Connector framework to understand how the pattern works and how it fits into a layered design. The source is in my [Git repository](https://github.com/yjung93/study_reactor_1_0).  
This version keeps the core architectural ideas from ACE while intentionally skipping production-level complexity.

### Structure
The implementation is organized into three layers:

+ **Event infrastructure layer classes**
+ **Connection management layer classes**
+ **Application layer classes**

The relationships between classes in this framework are shown below.

### Event infrastructure layer classes
This simplified framework is built on top of a **Reactor** framework that provides event demultiplexing and dispatching. For details, see the previous post: [Reactor Pattern](/design%20pattern%20-%20ace%20framework/post-reactor/).

### Connection management layer classes
This layer provides **generic, application-independent** connection and initialization services. It consists of:

+ **ServiceHandler**
+ **Acceptor**
+ **Connector**

#### ServiceHandler
+ Defines the interfaces needed by an application service implementation.
+ Concrete services typically act as a client, a server, or both in a peer-to-peer system.
+ Created by an **Acceptor** or **Connector** when a connection is established.
+ Provides a hook that the Acceptor/Connector calls to activate the service once the connection is ready.
+ Exposes a **transport endpoint** used by the application service to communicate with its peer. The endpoint type is parameterized (template) so the OS-specific I/O implementation stays separate from application logic.

#### Acceptor
+ **Passively** establishes a connected transport endpoint.
+ Creates and initializes the associated **ServiceHandler** when a connection is accepted.
+ Decouples acceptance/initialization from the ServiceHandler that runs application logic.

**Interaction sequence**

#### Connector
+ **Actively** establishes a connected transport endpoint.
+ Creates and initializes the associated **ServiceHandler** when the connection completes.
+ Decouples initiation/initialization from the ServiceHandler that runs application logic.
+ Supports **synchronous** and **asynchronous** connection.

### Application layer classes
This layer customizes the generic strategies from the infrastructure and connection layers (via subclassing, composition, and/or template instantiation) to create concrete components that establish connections, exchange data, and implement service behavior.

#### Server application
Demonstration server: waits for client connections, accepts them, and echoes messages received from clients.

![Component diagram — example server (Acceptor-Connector)](/assets/images/example_acceptor_connector_server_diagram.png)

##### AcceptorImpl
- Concrete subclass of **Acceptor**.
- Plays the acceptor role by deriving from the Acceptor class.

##### InputHandler
- Concrete subclass of **ServiceHandler**.
- Handles client I/O and echoes back received messages.

#### Client application
Demonstration client: sends user-typed messages to the server and displays the responses.

![Component diagram — example client (Acceptor-Connector)](/assets/images/example_acceptor_connector_client_diagram.png)

##### Client
- A **facade** that composes a **Connector** and a **ServiceHandler**.

##### ConnectorImpl
- Concrete subclass of **Connector**.
- Plays the connector role by deriving from the Connector class.

##### OutputHandler
- Concrete subclass of **ServiceHandler**.
- Forwards user-typed messages to the server and prints replies.

##### Dynamics
This diagram shows how the client and server components interact to establish connections and run the service logic.
