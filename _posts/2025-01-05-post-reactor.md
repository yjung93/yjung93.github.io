## Overview
The **Reactor pattern** uses a single event loop to demultiplex I/O events and dispatch them to registered handlers. This post is exploring the pattern through a **simplified** implementation inspired by [the Adaptive Communication Environment (ACE)](https://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html), focusing on the essentials rather than production complexity. My goal here is to share what I’ve been studying and building.

## Simplified Reactor framework implementation
I built a small, learning-oriented framework that retains the core ideas from ACE (initiation dispatcher, event demultiplexing, handler registration) while keeping the code minimal. The source is in my [Git repository](https://github.com/yjung93/study_reactor_1_0).

### Structure
At a high level:

+ **Reactor** – runs the event loop, waits for events, dispatches to handlers.
+ **EventHandler** – base class; concrete handlers implement the I/O logic.

### Core classes

#### Reactor
- Maintains a registry of active handlers.
- Uses a synchronous demultiplexer (e.g., `select`) to wait for activity.
- Dispatches `handleInput(fd)` on the ready handlers.
- Provides `registerHandler()` and `removeHandler()` to manage the registry and lifetime.

#### EventHandler
- Base interface for application-specific handlers.
- Stores the OS handle/FD and a back-reference to the `Reactor`.
- Overridable `handleInput(fd)` method contains the actual I/O logic for each handler.

### Interaction sequence
1. Handlers register themselves (or are registered by an acceptor) with the `Reactor`.
2. The `Reactor` blocks in `select()` and wakes when one or more FDs are ready.
3. For each ready FD, the corresponding handler’s `handleInput(fd)` is invoked.
4. Handlers may read/write, create new handlers (e.g., for new connections), or deregister on close.

### Example: echo server and client
For a quick demo, I built a tiny echo server using:
- An **Acceptor**-like handler for passive opens (creates a per-connection handler).
- A **Server handler** that reads data and echoes it back.
- A simple **client** that connects, sends user input, and prints the response.

#### How it works
- The Acceptor listens for new client connections. When a connection is established, it creates a ServerEventHandler and registers it with the Reactor.
- The Reactor monitors all registered event handlers using the select() system call and delegates events to their respective handlers.
- The ServerEventHandler processes client messages and echoes them back​

This shows how the Reactor’s single event loop can manage multiple connections cleanly, while each handler stays focused on its own responsibility.
